# Extreme Weather Events Research

Hello! Here is my work during the summer of 2024 on investigating extreme weather events. 
I primarily had an interest in precipitation extremes, its causes, and its impacts on events such as floods and droughts. 
I mostly used the programming languages R and Python.

I worked as a Research Assistant for the University of British Columbia as a Statistics student under an NSERC grant. 
Professors Natalia Nolde and Harry Joe were my supervisors in the Statistics department.

If you have any questions about my work, feel free to email me and ask!
