    "* **Teleconnection pattern**\n",
    "  * Significant relationships or links between weather phenomena at widely separated locations on earth, which typically entail climate patterns that span thousands of miles\n",

    "### Motivation behind project\n",
    "* Floods!\n",
    "  * lead to numerous casualties and significant material losses\n",
    "  * Driver of this is... Extreme precipitation!\n",
    "  * Understanding extreme precipitation events (EPEs) is what helps us to accurately predict, assess and mitigate the risk of floods.\n",
    "  * The physical drivers of EPEs are poorly known (more research needs to be done as such :) )\n",
    "---\n",
    "* There have been many studies on how the winter precipitation is attributed to NAO\n",
    "* HOWEVER! Extreme precipitation is often characterized by a high spatio-temporal variability\n",
    "* So it is only moderately correlated to these circulation patterns\n",
    "* We end up getting very different results for the northern and southern regions of Morocco (from other papers!)\n",
    "* Therefore, each region will have strongly different climate drivers of extreme precipitations\n",
    "* This stark difference in Morocco is what makes this an important study, as well that it is a poor country in Africa that need 'help'.\n",
    "* Therefore, we want to assess the spatial distribution and drivers of EPEs in Morocco.\n",
    "* We do this by introducing a regionalization procedure that partitions Morocco into several spatially homogeneous regions with similar timing of extreme precipitation"

    "### Short Summary\n",
    "* There are oscillation patters. These create teleconnection patterns, which is when weather is linked between two different places on Earth. We can make teleconnection indices, which help us understand these patterns.\n",
    "* However, it is often assumed that these patterns affect the Extreme Precipitation Events(EPEs) in Morocco \"uniformly\". Yet each region within Morocco has different drivers for their EPEs, and we cannot assume that it works the same across the whole country. Therefore, we want to find the spatial distribution and drivers of EPEs in Morocco."

    "### Future interests\n",
    "* Teleconnection patterns are subject to change as Earth's climate warms, so it would be interesting and important to continue this study and ensure/observe accurate information over time.\n",
    "* Similarly, Extreme Precipitation Events have generally increased in frequency and intensity due to anthropogenic global warming, and will continue to do so in the future\n",
    "* A study found that ENSO had limited impacts on the 2015-2016 droughts in Morocco, but other teleconnections, specifically the NAO and MO had greater impacts! So maybe observe how the oscillations affect the rainfall (instead of droughts).\n",
    "* Interest in how climate varies across countries such as Canada (considering we have temperature rainforests(Vancouver) and deserts (Okanogan)), it would be cool to look at the different EPE regions in countries to help understand if that helps to explain the extreme weather events of flooding\n",
    "* Notes on what they recommend and mention\n",
    "* They want to use their results to:\n",
    "  * assess EPEs impacts on economy and citizens\n",
    "  * improve understanding of hydrological implication of EP\n",
    "  * assess the regionalization of physical drivers for OTHER weather extremes like cold and heat waves (in Morocco)\n",
    "  * use results as a foundation to assess the impacts of climate change on EPEs\n",
    "  * exploit results as a feature selection step in the development of statistical downscaling models for EP forecasts "
